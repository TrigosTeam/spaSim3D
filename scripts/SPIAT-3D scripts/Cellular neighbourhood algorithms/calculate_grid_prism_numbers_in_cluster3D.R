### Start from the grid_prism with the maximum cell proportion.
## Look left, right, forward, back, up and down and see if that grid_prism has at least threshold cell proportion value
## If it does, add it to the answer
## Keep doing this until adjacent grid prisms don't have above threshold, or if you hit a boundary, or it has already been removed
## Return a vector containing all the grid prism numbers which COULD be part of the cluster
